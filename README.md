## Overview

This repository contains a Node.js application that interacts with a MySQL database to manage application releases across various environments (accounts and regions). The goal of this exercise is to containerise the solution and help identify "drift" in production environments â€” cases where the latest version of an application is not deployed to all accounts and regions. Your tasks will involve enhancing the application, securing the infrastructure, and implementing drift detection.

### Existing Schema

The `releases` table schema in the MySQL database is as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE releases (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,                     -- The name of the application
    version VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,                   -- The version of the application
    account VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,                  -- The account in which the app is deployed
    region VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL                    -- The region in which the app is deployed
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  -- The timestamp when the release was created
);
```
    

The table tracks various deployments of applications across multiple accounts and regions. Each row represents a release of an application in a specific account and region.
There are ten unique applications (name), there are n number of versions for each application, and each application can be deployed in multiple accounts and regions.
There is one staging account and five production accounts, each account has two regions - primary and secondary.

### Applications
- application_one
- application_two
- application_three
- application_four
- application_five
- application_six
- application_seven
- application_eight
- application_nine
- application_ten

### Accounts and Regions
- staging
    - primary
    - secondary
- prod_one
    - primary
    - secondary
- prod_two
    - primary
    - secondary
- prod_three
    - primary
    - secondary
- prod_four
    - primary
    - secondary
- prod_five
    - primary
    - secondary

## Current State

The application currently has two main routes:
- `POST /createRelease`: Creates a new release for an application.
- `GET /listReleases`: Lists all releases in the database.

Additionally, there is a drift detection endpoint:
- `GET /drift`: This endpoint is supposed to detect and return environments (accounts/regions) where the latest version of an application is not deployed. Currently, this endpoint returns a hardcoded JSON object as a placeholder (snippet below):

```json
[
        { 
            "application_one": {
                "latest" : "3.0.1",
                "drift": {
                    "prod_five" : { "primary": "2.9.9", "secondary": "2.9.9" }
                }
            }
        }
]
```

Your task is to implement the logic to accurately detect drift and enhance other aspects of the system as detailed below.

## Tasks

### 1. Containerization
- Use **Docker** and **Docker Compose** to containerize the Node.js application and MySQL database.
- Ensure both services can communicate within a Docker network.
- The MySQL container should be initialized using the provided SQL scripts which can be found in the mysql folder.

### 2. Implement the Drift Detection Logic
- **Enhance the `/drift` Endpoint**:
  - Implement the logic to detect drift in the `GET /drift` endpoint.
  - The endpoint should return a list of applications that are not running the latest version in every `account` and `region`.
  - Expected output format should match the example snippet shown above (see placeholder data in code)

### 3. Secure the Node.js Application
  - Add an API key authentication middleware to one or more endpoints. A basic API key implementation is acceptable, but ensure the key is passed securely in request headers.

### 4. Github Actions Workflow 
 - Create a Github Actions workflow that builds the code and logs the result of ` /drift ` API.

## Deliverables
- A working `docker-compose.yml` file.
    -  `docker-compose up` should reliably start the Node.js application and MySQL database without errors.
- An updated Node.js application with:
  - A fully implemented `/drift` endpoint.
  - Authentication on one or more endpoints.
  - Github Actions workflow that builds using docker-compose and logs the result of drift API.
